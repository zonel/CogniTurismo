- 📡 **Mosquitto (MQTT Broker)**: Handles real-time ingestion of telemetry data from connected vehicles using the MQTT protocol.

- ⚡ **Dapper**: Lightweight and efficient database access for high-throughput workloads.

- 🐳 **Docker Compose**: Simplifies deployment of the full system for local testing or cloud use.

### 🎯 Use Cases
This template is ideal for developers who want to:

- 📡 Handle real-time data from IoT devices or connected vehicles using **MQTT**.

- 🛠️ Learn distributed database patterns in a real-world context.

- 🚀 Build scalable systems without dealing with unnecessary complexity.
